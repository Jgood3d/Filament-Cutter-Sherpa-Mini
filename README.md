Filament Cutter Sherpa Mini Base ERCF

You will need to glue the blade into the blade holder.

The blade used is a standard 9mm cutter blade only the starting part is used.

Then you will also need to glue the cutter block.

Use a fairly strong spring with a 3mm screw which will come to rest on the side of your printer.

For the moment only support for switchwire has been made.

I am waiting for the use of makers who could possibly provide an stl or a method for voron 2.4 or trident
